UV scheme for animating the pixel strips

- Texture
    - Tiling: The fraction of the full image to be displayed
        - X
            - naive: `1/128`
            - omitting leftmost pixel: `(7/8)/128`
            - addressing UV bleeding: 
                - `del_frac = 1/128`
                - `((7/8)/128)*(1-del_frac)`
        - Y
            - naive: `1/128`
            - better: `1e-13`
            - even better: `0.5/128`

    - Offset: Starting at the far left, moving right. Starting at the bottom, moving up.
        - X
            - naive: `color_int/128`
            - omitting leftmost pixel: `color_int/128 + 1/1024`
            - addressing UV bleeding: 
                - `color_int/128 + 1/1024`
                - `+ ((7/8)/128)*(del_frac/2)`
            - animation:
                - from
                    - `0/128 + 1/1024`
                    - `+ ((7/8)/128)*(del_frac/2)`
                - to
                    - `127/128 + 1/1024`
                    - `+ ((7/8)/128)*(del_frac/2)`, putting the entire constant offset in `PxColors`
                      - apparently constant offsets are ignored in additive animations??????????
        - Y
            - manually in editor, naive: `px_int/128`
            - manually in editor, better: `(px_int + 0.5)/128`
            - animation: from `0.5/128` to `127.5/128`
            - manually in editor, even better: `(px_int + 0.25)/128`
            - animation: from `0/128` to `127/128`, putting a constant `0.25/128` offset in `PxColors`
                - apparently constant offsets are ignored in additive animations??????????
